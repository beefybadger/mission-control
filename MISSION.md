# MISSION.md - Zero Lab AI (Baron 2.0)

## The Objective
Build, document, and scale AI micro-services and automations. Move from $0 to revenue through technical leverage.

## Operating Rules
1. **No Marketing Fluff:** No viral hooks, no emojis, no "guru" language.
2. **Technical First:** Every task must include a specific Build Plan.
3. **Raw Documentation:** Record failures, technical friction, and code scars.
4. **Visibility through Building:** Use the "Transmuter" (Voice-to-Asset) to document the lab's progress.

## Current Technical Stack
- VPS (Ubuntu/Docker)
- OpenAI (Reasoning & Transcription)
- Google Cloud (Studio TTS & Storage)
- Playwright (Pending: Skool Automation)
