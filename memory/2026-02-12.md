# Memory Log: 2026-02-12

## Context
Transitioned from "Infrastructure/Skool" phase to "No-Human Company" revenue generation. Robert requested a full purge of legacy assets to start fresh on a clean, secure VPS slate.

## Decisions & Actions
- **Purge:** Deleted all legacy scripts (`kpo_repo`, `skool_agent`, `competitor_scraper`, etc.) after syncing core directives to Notion.
- **Security:** Installed Tailscale on the VPS and configured `tailscale serve` to proxy the OpenClaw Gateway (Port 3000) over a private, encrypted tunnel. MagicDNS: `87e478b14c7f.tailde5298.ts.net`.
- **Compliance:** Established GDPR-first building standards (EU residency, 14-day auto-purge of PII).
- **Prototype:** Built `receptionist.py` and `brain_api.py`. A live FastAPI-based AI brain that qualifies leads and requests booking details (Address/Phone) for local services.

## Pivot: Sales-First & Teacher Mode
- **Strategic Pivot:** Dropped the "Local Gap-Filler AI Agency" model due to friction/mismatch (Robert found it unappealing).
- **New Objective:** Exploration of high-leverage, low-friction business models (The Ghost, Micro-SaaS, Intelligence Arbitrage).
- **Research:** Deployed **Maurice** to scout Feb 2026 trends.
- **Identified Opportunities (Feb 2026 Trends):**
    - **The Ghost (Content/Digital Assets):** Automated niche newsletters, faceless channels, niche affiliate sites.
    - **Niche Intelligence Newsletter:** Scraping niche forums/Discord for "under-the-radar" trends to sell to professionals ($10-20/mo).
    - **Vibe-Coded Micro-SaaS:** Single-purpose AI tools with high "taste" (e.g., turning LinkedIn posts to TikTok scripts).
    - **VIP Digital Concierge:** AI filters for creator DMs/Emails to prioritize sponsorships ($500/mo retainer).
- **Operational Rule:** **Advice & Teacher Mode Active.** Baron will not execute builds/file changes without explicit approval.
- **System Maintenance:** Implemented automated hourly **Context Purge** and Memory Sync (cron job) to manage TPM/Context limits.
- **Technical Pivots:**
    - Paused "Mission Control" (Redis/Event-Driven) to prevent over-engineering.
    - Strategy to reduce TPM includes surgical file loading, summarized memory, and Sub-Agent (Scotty/Maurice) delegation.
- **Reference Material:** Reviewed YouTube video `NQ1IR4Z_3RY` ("Don't start an AI business before watching this").
    - **Key Takeaway:** Move away from "Thin Wrappers" and "Boring Agency Traps."
    - **Confirmed Direction:** Pivot toward **Scalable, Product-Led** models (No-Human Media Company, Bespoke AI Workflow Software) rather than Service-Led/Agency models.
- **Next Step:** Robert is currently weighing "The Ghost" (Content) vs. "Micro-SaaS" vs. "Digital Concierge," with a strong inclination toward **Product-Led Scalability**.

## Late Evening Session: Mission Control (Second Brain) Build-out
- **Strategic Direction:** Re-activated "Mission Control" dashboard development under the project name **Second Brain**.
- **Aesthetic Direction:** Linear-style, high-end "industrial" UI (Black/Charcoal palette, glassmorphism, structured Kanban).
- **Technical Stack:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (Database + Realtime).
- **Infrastructure:** Dashboard live on Tailscale at `http://87e478b14c7f.tailde5298.ts.net:3001`.
- **Functional Achievements:**
    - **Kanban System:** Real-time task syncing with Supabase (Backlog vs. In-Progress).
    - **Live Activity Feed:** Side-panel hooked to `memories` table to show agent actions/thoughts.
    - **Council Interface:** Dedicated tab for interacting with specific agent personas (**Baron**, **Scotty**, **Maurice**).
    - **Messaging Layer:** Real-time chat modal via Supabase, enabling direct communication with Council members from the UI.
    - **Performance Optimization:** Refactored to Next.js Server Components/Actions for instant loading.
    - **Semantic Search:** Enabled `pgvector` in Supabase; `match_memories` function and embeddings sync (`sync-memory.ts`) deployed for concept-based search.
    - **Cron Manager:** Fully operational "Cron Ops" tab integrated into the dashboard. Allows live viewing, enabling/disabling, deleting, and manual triggering of OpenClaw cron jobs.
    - **System Control:** Integrated "Pause System" and "Ping Baron" functionality into the global dashboard header.
- **UI/UX Transformation:** 
    - Overhauled the dashboard with a high-end "Linear/Raycast" aesthetic (solid black #000, sidebar #090909).
    - Implemented a functional **Command Palette (CMD+K)** and **VPS Explorer** for filesystem transparency.
    - Standardized path aliases (`@/lib/utils`) and installed `framer-motion`, `clsx`, and `tailwind-merge` for robust, animated interactions.
    - Fixed build errors related to missing utility modules and improper import paths.
- **Backend Architecture:**
    - Developed a secure API bridge (`/api/cron`) that executes **OpenClaw CLI** commands directly via `child_process` (shell) to manage system-level automation from the web UI.
    - Resolved Next.js "use client" vs Server Component conflicts in the root layout.
    - Hardened the `next.config.ts` to handle Tailscale cross-origin headers and dev-server stability.
- **Sub-Agent Delegation:** Used specialized sub-agents (NextJS-Specialist, NextJS-Architect, UI-UX-Designer) for internal wiring, architectural audits, and visual refinements.
- **Automated Intelligence:**
    - **Morning Brief:** Scheduled cron job (08:30 GMT+1) to deliver market intelligence, business ideas, and tasks via Telegram.
- **Mission Control Operations Rule:** 
    - Every time a new cron job is added or modified via the CLI, the Mission Control dashboard must be refreshed/synced to reflect the current state of automated loops.
- **Next Step:** Receive first Morning Brief and begin executing "Ghost" or "Micro-SaaS" strategy from the new Command Center.
