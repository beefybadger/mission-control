# Memory Log: 2026-02-13

## Current Context
Robert is focused on "Mission Control," a high-end dashboard (Next.js/Supabase) running on Tailscale. The goal is to create a "Command Center" for a "No-Human Media Company" or scalable product-led business.

## Status: Mission Control (Second Brain)
- **Live URL:** `http://87e478b14c7f.tailde5298.ts.net:3001`
- **Frontend:** Next.js with Linear/Industrial aesthetic. Kanban for tasks, live activity feed for memories.
- **Backend:** Supabase for real-time data sync.
- **System Integration:** Bridge to OpenClaw CLI (`openclaw status --json`, `openclaw cron list --json`) enables monitoring of token burn, costs, and automated loops from the web UI.

## Active Automated Loops (Cron)
1. **Hourly Context Purge & Memory Sync:** Periodically distills chat history into daily logs to manage context pressure.
2. **Morning Brief (08:30 Berlin):** Prepares daily intel (news, business ideas, tasks) and delivers via Telegram.

## Technical Pivots
- **Infrastructure:** Using Tailscale for secure, zero-config access to local services (FastAPI brain at 8000, Dashboard at 3001).
- **Architecture:** Moving away from "Agency/Service" models toward "Product-Led/Media" models (The Ghost, Micro-SaaS).

## Next Steps
- Implement "Council Interface" to allow direct tasking of Scotty (Research) and Maurice (Creative) from the dashboard.
- Finalize first "Product-Led" build based on Morning Brief recommendations.
